#Code Book
## This code book summarize the variables and general aspects of the experiment

#Experiment description
The experiment was performed with a group of 30 volunteers. They experimented 6 different activities during a day (walking, 
walking up stairs, walking down stairs, sitting, standing, laying). All this activities was monitored through 561 measurements
recorded by a Samsung SmartPhone that they worn at the waist. 

#Variables
The data has three main type of data: the type of activity, the subject and the measurements.

## Type of activiy 
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

## Subject
30 volunteers numbered from 1 to 30

## Measurements
In the tidy data I got 66 features as listed below:
